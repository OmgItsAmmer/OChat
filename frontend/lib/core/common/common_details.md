## Individual Widget Files:

- `form_divider.dart`: This widget provides a visual divider specifically designed for forms, helping to visually separate different sections of input fields for better organization and user experience.

- `sociol_buttons.dart`: This widget likely encapsulates various social media-related buttons, such as those for social login (e.g., Google, Facebook) or sharing content to social platforms.

- `network_aware_widget.dart`: This widget is designed to be "aware" of the device's network connectivity. It can display different UI elements or provide different functionalities based on whether the device is online or offline, enhancing the user experience by providing immediate feedback on network status.

- `network_status_widget.dart`: This widget is dedicated to displaying the current network status of the application. It might show indicators or text to inform the user about their connection, such as "Online," "Offline," or "Connecting."

## Widget Subdirectories:

- `appbar/`: This directory contains widgets that are typically used for creating application bars (AppBars) at the top of screens. These may include custom designs, titles, action buttons, and navigation elements.

- `brand/`: This directory likely holds widgets related to displaying brand information, such as brand logos, names, or brand-specific cards and showcases.

- `chips/`: Contains widgets for interactive "chips," which are compact elements that represent an attribute, text, entity, or action. These can be used for filtering, selections, or input.

- `curved_edges/`: This directory is dedicated to widgets that implement curved edges or custom clipping paths for UI elements, providing a visually appealing and modern design.

- `custom_shapes/`: This directory houses widgets that create and manage various custom shapes and containers beyond standard Flutter widgets, allowing for unique UI designs.

- `icons/`: This directory contains widgets specifically designed for displaying various icons throughout the application, potentially with custom sizing, coloring, or interaction features.

- `image_text_widgets/`: This directory contains widgets that combine images and text elements. These are often used for components like category items, product cards, or user profile displays where an image is paired with descriptive text.

- `images/`: This directory is for general-purpose widgets that handle the display of images, potentially including features like image loading, caching, or different display modes (e.g., rounded images).

- `layout/`: This directory provides widgets that assist in structuring the overall layout of screens or sections of the UI, such as grid layouts, column/row arrangements, or responsive designs.

- `list_tile/`: This directory contains widgets for creating list tiles, which are commonly used in lists, menus, or settings screens to display an item with a title, subtitle, and optional leading/trailing widgets.

- `loaders/`: This directory is for widgets that provide loading animations or indicators to inform the user that content is being loaded or an operation is in progress, improving perceived performance.

- `shimmers/`: This directory contains widgets that implement shimmering loading effects, which are animated placeholders that appear while content is loading, offering a more polished user experience than a static loading indicator.

- `success_screen/`: This directory holds widgets related to displaying success messages or entire success screens after a user completes a specific action, such as a purchase or form submission.

- `texts/`: This directory contains widgets for various text styles and components. These widgets likely provide consistent typography, custom text formatting, and possibly text with integrated icons or interactive elements.
